# Politwics.net monitors and maps political tweets

## Basic idea:
* Crawl the (re)tweets from a pre-specified list of politically active people (politicians a.o.)
* Store tweets, users, hashtags, links, source and other info in a [graph database](https://neo4j.com) based on (an extension of) this [model](http://network.graphdemos.com)
* Enrich the crawled data in multiple ways
* Mine and visualize the enriched data to uncover trends, relations, insights
